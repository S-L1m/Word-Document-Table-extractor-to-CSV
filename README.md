# Tables from Word Document to csv files

To be used to extract tables from 1 or more word documents and have the tables placed in a csv file. 
<br> There are two methods included in the Jupyter Notebook:
1. Grab data using text slicing method
2. Loop through docx.tables method

<br> The code requires input/changes to suit the REgex requirement
<br> However, this could be used as a starting point for a beginner/intermediate level coder to begin extracting tables from multiple word documents. 

<br> For the code that uses docx library (General Table Extractor). 1 x n, or n x n, or whatever variation of table is required - the method of writing the table to CSV, if you are wanting as per how the tables looks like in the word document, would depend on how the table_data variable is sliced before writing.
